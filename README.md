# Title

# Abstract
One of the most important factors in human health is how we eat. Over time, the way we eat changes significantly. Given the rate of change of human nutrition, we would like to investigate how our eating habits change over the years and also the differences in food consumption between different age groups, as well as whether this causes a noticeable difference in the rates of various nutritional deficiencies over time.

Certain health conditions are caused by malnutrition and nutritional deficits. A patient with such a condition will need to make dietary changes in order to combat the disease. However, different types of food are complex amalgamations of various nutrients, and if one wants to eat more of one specific nutrient, it could cause an increased consumption of certain other nutrients as well. Using datasets about recipes, we want to discover the correlation of the different ingredients to see if a certain nutrition recommendation may lead to an undesired indirect increase in other nutrients.


# Research questions
- What’s the difference in the consumption rate of healthy food between different age groups?
- What’s the difference in the consumption rate of healthy food for the same age group between different countries?
- What is the presence correlation between ingredients in recipes?
- Are there increases in the consumption of some ingredients when fighting against a specific disease via nutrition?
- Which recipes are recommended to fight against a specific disease while not resulting in an undesirable increase of some other ingredients?


# Dataset
The datasets we are going to use are the following:
- [EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database](http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/the-efsa-comprehensive-european-food-consumption-database): It has a size of 300.000 rows and 96 columns, with information related to products consumed, in which country, in which year and by which group of age among other things.
- [Open Food Fact](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data): for nutritional scores
- [Recipe1M+](http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu): For the recipe data.
